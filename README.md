## ‚ÅâÔ∏è How Private & Secure?

1. Alpine Linux base image
2. Docker runtime
3. Open source for open audits
4. Regular updates
5. Zero extra dependencies

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Architectures

At the time of this writing, @prisma/cli only supports AMD64

ARM64 support will come shortly after Prisma officially supports it.

[Relevant Github Issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/861)

## How it Works

A docker container with the latest LTS of NodeJS and the ```@prisma/cli``` module introspects your postgres database to auto-generate a prisma schema in the form ```schema.prisma```.

Prisma Studio is then made available at the port specified to display your data source.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Deploying

Use the included docker-compose.yml file as a base for your installation.

```dockerfile
version: '3.7'
services:
  prisma-studio:
    container_name: prisma-studio
    image: timothyjmiller/prisma-studio:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
     - .env
    ports:
      - ${PRISMA_STUDIO_PORT}:5555
  postgres:
    container_name: prisma-postgres
    image: postgres:alpine
    restart: always
    env_file:
     - .env
    ports:
      - ${POSTGRES_PORT}:5432
    networks:
      - https_proxy
    volumes:
      - ${POSTGRES_PATH}:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## üìÅ Environment Variables

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Make sure you securely generate new passwords for your postgres database for use with Prisma Studio.

1. Create a file named ```.env```

2. Give ```.env``` the following contents:

```bash
POSTGRES_DATABASE=development
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
PRISMA_STUDIO_PORT=5555
POSTGRES_PATH=/postgres
```

You may have to change the port numbers for postgres & Prisma Studio depending on the availability of your host machine.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Enterprise Deployments

For advanced deployments and/or consulting, [email me](mailto:contact@preparesoftware.com?subject=[GitHub%20Consulting]%20docker-prisma-studio) or [contact me on Discord](https://discord.gg/gtF4AX9UGA)

Create three ```.env``` configs

1. development
2. testing
3. production

Each config should have it's own database name (development, testing, and production), port number, plus unique passwords for each environment. Securely store the Postgres database credentials for safe-keeping.
